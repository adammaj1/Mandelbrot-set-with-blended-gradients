How to use [blend modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes) to make better images ( of Mandelbrot sets and ...)  
These images are inspired by great technique used by Adam Saka in [KFMovieMaker](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fractals/kallesfraktaler#KFMovieMaker) and his videos

# Algorithm 



## Blend modes

Blend types (= modes) definition

```c

typedef enum  {
	no = 0,
	average = 1	
		} BlendType; 
```




How to compute blended color from 2 input colors ? Here color is a single number (shades of gray)  

Basic is [average ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/726549/algorithm-for-additive-color-mixing-for-rgb-values)

```c
unsigned char GiveBlendedColor( double c1, double c2, BlendType Blend){

	unsigned char t;
	
	switch (Blend){
	
		case average: {t = (c1+c2)/2.0; break;}
		
		
		default: {}
	
	}
	
	return  t;


}

```


There are many blend modes

## potential (Linear step) plus slope

Here exterior of the Mandelbrot set is:
* described by potential
* coloured with 1D gray gradients

Interior is solid colour blue


First image is slope ( normal map = [Lambert reflection (Illumination model or shader )](https://gitlab.com/adammajewski/mandelbrot_wiki_ACh#using-complex-potential-and-lambert-reflection-illumination-model-or-shader-)   
![](./images/normal.png)  


Second image: 
* level sets of potential
* [linear step function](https://github.com/adammaj1/1D-RGB-color-gradient#gray-linear-colormap)

![](./images/Linear_steps.png "Gray Linear gradient ( colormap)")  
![](./images/Linear_steps_2D.png "RGB profiles of the GrayL colormap")    

![](./images/step_linear.png)  


3-rd image = Result of blending above images in average mode  

![](./images/average.png)  



## Potential ( sqrt step ) + slope


First image is the same as above = ( normal map = [Lambert reflection (Illumination model or shader )](https://gitlab.com/adammajewski/mandelbrot_wiki_ACh#using-complex-potential-and-lambert-reflection-illumination-model-or-shader-)



Second image: 
* level sets of potential
* [sqrt step function](https://github.com/adammaj1/1D-RGB-color-gradient#gray-sqrt-colormap). It is inverterd

```c
 p = 1.0 - p;
```

3-rd image = Result of blending above images in average mode
